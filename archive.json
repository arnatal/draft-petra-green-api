      "body": "# What's Changed\r\nAdded two new use cases to expand PETRA's applicability in modern network environments:\r\n\r\n- Energy-Aware Service Routing: Extended SD-WAN section to show how PETRA enables network controllers (SD-WAN, 5G slice orchestrators, etc.) to optimize path selection based on energy consumption alongside traditional performance metrics.\r\n\r\n- SLA Negotiation for Energy-Efficient Services: New section demonstrating how operators can use PETRA metrics to offer environmentally-focused SLAs, allowing customers to select services based on renewable energy usage and sustainability targets.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nBroadens PETRA from basic energy monitoring to advanced routing decisions and business-level sustainability commitments\r\nAddresses growing enterprise demand for verifiable environmental compliance\r\nPositions PETRA as a comprehensive energy-aware networking solution",
